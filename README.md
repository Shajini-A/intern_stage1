# Stage 1 – Skill Assessment Task

This project is part of my submission for Stage 1 of the Skill Assessment. It demonstrates an interactive canvas application built with React and [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/), showcasing basic shape rendering, event handling, and user-driven customization.

## 🔧 Features

- Add basic shapes (rectangle, circle, triangle) to the canvas  
- Dynamically add multiple shapes to the canvas  
- Customize shape colors via user input  
- Detect and log mouse click events on shapes  
- Real-time event logging in the UI

## 💡 Approach

I explored the Fabric.js documentation to understand its canvas API and implemented key features such as shape creation, dynamic addition of shapes, color selection, and event listening. React was used to manage the UI components and render updates.
